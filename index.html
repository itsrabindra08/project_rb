   <center> <h2>Mushroom Veggie Burger</h2></center>
<center><img src="burger.jpeg" alt="Burger"></center>
<p>These vegetarian mushroom burgers are as close as I've ever gotten to delicious meatless burgers. Mushrooms really give them a meaty flavor. I like to serve them on fresh hamburger rolls with spicy mayonnaise and a little lettuce.</p>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
    <li>3 (8 ounce) packages sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
    <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
    <li>⅔ cup rolled oats</li>
    <li>½ cup freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
</ul>
<h1>Directions</h1><br>
<h2>Step1</h2>
<p>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and oregano; cook and stir until mushrooms have released their juices and the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.</p>

<h2>Step2</h2>
<p>Transfer mushrooms to a cutting board and clean the skillet.</p>
    <h2>Step3</h2>
    <p>Chop mushrooms into small chunks, then transfer to a large bowl. Mix in bread crumbs and oats, and season with salt and pepper as needed. Stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, then eggs; let stand until bread crumbs have absorbed any excess liquid, about 15 minutes. Use moist hands to form mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, into patties.</p>
    <h2>Step4</h2>
    <p>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry patties in the hot skillet until golden brown and cooked through, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side.</p>
